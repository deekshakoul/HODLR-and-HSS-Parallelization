This was a part of my BTech Thesis Project for the duration of four month starting from 16th Dec'16 to 28th Apr'17 .
It involves parallel implementation of "Factorization based solvers" for HODLR(hierarchically off-diagonal low-rank) matrices and implementation of "Extended based sparsification solvers"
for HSS(hierarchically semi-separable) matrices.
